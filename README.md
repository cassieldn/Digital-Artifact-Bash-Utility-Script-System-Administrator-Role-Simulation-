# Digital-Artifact-Bash-Utility-Script-System-Administrator-Role-Simulation-
Imagine you’re a system administrator juggling multiple tasks, trying to keep the digital world running smoothly. Now, picture a nifty little tool that helps you automate backup processes, manage files, and keeps everything neatly logged. That’s exactly what my digital artifact does!
In this project, I created a Bash utility script designed to save system administrators time and hassle. It handles everything from directory navigation to automated backups, all with a clean, easy-to-use interface. I also built in a man page so even the least tech-savvy sysadmin can get up to speed quickly.

This digital artifact is perfect for anyone who wants a streamlined approach to system management – because let’s face it, nobody wants to waste time doing manual backups when you can have a script handle it for you!
